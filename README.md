# coccinellidae
The Coccinellidae web browser. The goal is to create a traditional browser UI (how things was before Chrome).

This is a fork of [Ladybird](https://github.com/awesomekling/ladybird).

This is a personal fork for my own enjoyment and learning :^)

Hardcoded for qt5 until I get an environment that can run qt6.

How does Coccinellidae differ from Ladybird?

This is what I'm going for:
